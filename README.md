# TV Subscription UI

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install all the dependecies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
(API is listening only to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))

## Dev

If you want to create a new page, create a folder in app with the name of the endpoint and a page.tsx file to render, and then put route in drawerContent in layout.tsx file to add it to the left drawer
